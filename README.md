# Codebase

## Backend
The backend of the application is Firebase. Firebase is a free cloud-based service that simplifies and automates hosting and databases, and supports secure identification methods. Explore uses firebase to store ads, destinations, geodata, reviews, role, users, visits. 


## Frontend
The front end of the application is divided into the folders 'views', 'styles', and 'components'. The 'views' folder contains the different pages of the application. The 'components' are independent and reusable bits of code. Some components, like 'navbar.js', are used on every single page. The 'styles' folder contains the CSS files that style the different files in 'views'.
